# Buzz's Lighthouse Website

This repository contains a static recreation of the website available at [buzzslighthouse.com](https://www.buzzslighthouse.com/). The HTML pages here are simplified for easy deployment on Vercel. Images are referenced by name; add them to the `public/images` directory after downloading them separately.


## Local Development

Static HTML files are placed in the `public` directory. Deploy this folder to Vercel or any other static hosting provider. Place downloaded images into `public/images` with the filenames referenced in the HTML.
