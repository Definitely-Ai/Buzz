Historic Coastal Dining in Naples, Florida Since 1980

A Family-Owned Naples Landmark Offering Classic Florida Flavors and
Unforgettable Coastal Views

The Beginning of a Dream
Our story began in the mid-1970s when Henry “Buzz” Dugan and his wife Judy,
avid travelers from the Jersey Shore, discovered the tranquil beauty of Naples
and Vanderbilt Beach. Captivated by the area's charm, they found a perfect
piece of waterfront property in 1978. This location became the foundation of
their dream: a family-oriented restaurant that would embody the essence of old
Florida, offering breathtaking views and a warm, inviting atmosphere.

Opening Our Doors to Naples
In March 1980, Buzz's Lighthouse Restaurant officially opened its doors. It
quickly became a beloved local spot, celebrated for its fresh seafood and
hearty sandwiches. Buzz and Judy had a vision of creating a place where
families could gather, enjoy warm weather, sip on ice-cold beer, and savor food
that was always fresh from the Gulf. Their unwavering commitment to quality,
family, and hospitality has been the cornerstone of our success for over four
decades.

A Naples Classic Through the Years
Buzz's Lighthouse has stood the test of time, remaining a cherished Naples
classic loved by both locals and visitors alike. Despite the rapid changes in
the surrounding area and challenges like Hurricane Ian—which caused significant
damage shortly after a major kitchen renovation—our commitment to excellent
food and heartfelt service has never wavered. The restaurant continues to
thrive as a family-run business.

A Celebration of Tradition and Family
At Buzz's Lighthouse, every meal is more than just food—it's a celebration of
our rich history, deep-rooted family values, and the vibrant culinary
traditions of Naples. We invite you to join us, share in our story, and create
lasting memories with your loved ones.

Welcome to the Family
We look forward to welcoming you into our family at Buzz's Lighthouse
Restaurant, where the legacy of Buzz Dugan continues to shine brightly on the
beautiful shores of Naples.
