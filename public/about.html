  <p>Historic Coastal Dining in Naples, Florida Since 1980</p>
  <p>A Family-Owned Naples Landmark Offering Classic Florida Flavors and Unforgettable Coastal Views.</p>
  <h3>The Beginning of a Dream</h3>
  <p>Our story began in the mid-1970s when Henry “Buzz” Dugan and his wife Judy discovered the tranquil beauty of Naples and Vanderbilt Beach. Captivated by the area, they found a perfect piece of waterfront property in 1978 and started building their dream.</p>
  <h3>Opening Our Doors to Naples</h3>
  <p>In March 1980, Buzz's Lighthouse Restaurant officially opened. Buzz and Judy aimed to create a place where families could gather, enjoy warm weather, sip on cold drinks, and savor food fresh from the Gulf.</p>
  <h3>A Naples Classic Through the Years</h3>
  <p>Despite the rapid changes in the area and challenges like Hurricane Ian, our commitment to excellent food and heartfelt service has never wavered. Buzz's Lighthouse continues to thrive as a family-run business.</p>
  <h3>A Celebration of Tradition and Family</h3>
  <p>Every meal at Buzz's Lighthouse is a celebration of our rich history and culinary traditions. We invite you to join us and create lasting memories with your loved ones.</p>
